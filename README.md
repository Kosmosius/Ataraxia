## Introduction
Welcome to Ataraxia, a game where characters evolve from their birth through various lifepaths, encountering challenges that range from societal structures to fantastical elements. This RPG aims for a balance between narrative depth and gameplay simplicity, allowing for a rich yet streamlined experience.

## Dice Mechanics
Dice rolls in Ataraxia determine outcomes of actions, using standard six-sided dice. Characters’ abilities are represented as stats, influencing the dice rolled in tests for success or failure.

## Character Creation
Characters in Ataraxia are developed through a lifepath system, gaining skills, traits, and resources that reflect their journey from birth. Stats such as Will, Intellect, Strength, Fortitude, Agility, and Endurance form the core of character abilities, influencing tests and conflicts throughout the game.

## The Game World
Ataraxia’s world is a tapestry of medieval analogs, undefined yet richly implied through lifepaths and game mechanics. It encompasses societal structures, languages, and a historical setting akin to sixteenth-century Earth, with allowances for anachronisms to suit fantasy narratives.

## Equipment and Magic
Characters equip themselves for adventure, managing inventory slots based on their attributes. Magic in Ataraxia involves constructing spells through arcane words, offering a flexible system to alter reality within the game's mystical constraints.

## Conflict and Gameplay Loop
Conflict resolution cycles through intent, task, test, and resolution phases, driving both character development and the story forward. The gameplay loop encapsulates exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, structuring gameplay into coherent narratives.

## Exploration and The World Module
An optional module uses Tarot cards to generate terrain, weather, and conflicts, offering a procedural method to explore The World of Ataraxia. This system provides a framework for dynamic world-building and adventure creation.

## Support and Copyright
