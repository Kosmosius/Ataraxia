Welcome to the Game
Ataraxia is a tabletop role-playing game in the legacy of Dungeons & Dragons. While some of the rules and mechanics found in this book are dissimilar to traditional systems, many of the core ideas and spirit should still be familiar. The game centers around player created and controlled characters that interact with the world through dice rolls mediated by a Dungeon Master (DM), Game Master (GM), or Judge.
The central design consideration while developing this system was the question of how to build the most dynamic and complex gameplay out of the simplest initial rules, with minimal coercion and bookkeeping. These rules and mechanics are the result of that work, and I hope live up to the goal.
Dice Mechanics. All rolls use at least one standard six sided die (1d6). Each die roll is reduced to either a Success or Failure by rolls of 4,5,6, and 1,2,3, respectively. Multiple dice are often used to increase the odds of success. All character values are denominated in Dice.
Action Cycle & Conflict. All gameplay decisions are nested in a defined Action Cycle that allows for dynamic Conflict escalation and resolution.
Character Creation. Initial characters are created using a Lifepath system that instills them with a framework of capability, personality, and history.
Stats. Stats are the foundations of a character’s ability, and are subdivided into six values; Will, Intellect, Strength, Fortitude, Agility, and Endurance. Additionally, Stats can be used in tests of raw ability and advance through usage.
Attributes. A character’s Stats are added together to form Morale, Vitality, and Endurance values which act as independent health pools.
Skills. Skills are the means for a character to interact with the world in tasks that exceed raw ability. New skills can be organically acquired, and skills advance through use.
Personality. Characters are defined by their Beliefs, Traits, Instincts, and Connections which motivate action and produce Conflict. 
Gear & Equipment. Planning and applying the correct tool for the job makes otherwise impossible challenges doable. Items grant Advantage on all Tests they are applied to.
Rhetoric.* The training and techniques of combat can be leveraged to control the flow of the battlefield.  
Martial Combat. The training and techniques of combat can be leveraged to control the flow of the battlefield.  
Magic. Unique spells can be built through the combination of magical words into phrases using an arcane language system.
Divine. The Divine resides beyond the limits of known magic. Miracles are reserved for actions that break the laws of the universe.
World Generation. Tarot cards are used alongside lookup tables to generate terrain, weather, and dramatic scenes.  
Dice Mechanics
Ataraxia uses common six-sided dice; which players roll to determine the outcome of uncertain events in the game. The outcome depends upon the total number of successes the player rolls. 
Successes: Rolling a 4, 5, or 6 results in a Success.
Failures: Rolling a 1, 2, or 3 results in a Failure.
Comparing the total quantity of successes rolled against a target value, known as a “Test”, determines the final outcome. A Test’s difficulty increases with the target value required to pass the Test.
Root Dice
Root Dice serve as the basis for all tests in the game. These include: Stat, Skill, and Connection dice.
Dice Progression
All Root Dice can advance through usage. Root Dice advance by one rank when the player rolls the maximum number of successes possible excluding any bonus dice. For example, if a player rolls three successes using a third rank Hunting skill, the Hunting skill increases to fourth rank.
Bonus Dice
On occasion, Bonus Dice can be added to a roll. These dice do not increase the difficulty of advancing Root Dice values. Sub-types of Bonus Dice include Inspiration Dice and Exploding Dice.
Inspiration Dice: These dice can be applied at any time to any roll and persist across sessions. 
Exploding Dice: When a player rolls a ‘6’ while utilizing a magical skill or item—regardless of if the skill or item inherently contains or has been imbued with magic—the player can roll another die. If this Bonus Die also results in a ‘6’, another die can be rolled, ad infinitum. 
Advantage & Disadvantage 
Special circumstances can grant Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll. If a player accrues one or more counts of Advantage and Disadvantage, the total count of Advantages less the total count of Disadvantages determines the final adjustment. Items used to assist in passing a Test inherently grant one Advantage. Players may propose Advantage in a given circumstance; however, they must justify why that would be the case and the DM or party must agree with their reasoning.
Advantage: Advantage adds one success to the Root Die roll.
Disadvantage: Disadvantage subtracts one success from the Root Die roll.
Resistance & Vulnerability 
Certain items and Traits grant Damage Resistance or Vulnerability Dice. These dice decrease and increase incoming damage, respectively, but cannot overturn failure of a Test. The results of these rolls apply after a Test has completed. If the Damage Resistance Dice reduce incoming damage to zero, the Test resolves to a tie.
Damage Resistance (R): Successes count against incoming damage.
Damage Vulnerability (V): Failures count towards incoming damage. 
Action
The Action Cycle mediates every interaction between characters and the world. While multiple cycles can be nested within each other as the story demands, all conflict will eventually be resolved as an Action cycle is closed.
Intent
Players must clearly express what outcome they intend to occur as a result of their action at the beginning of an Action Cycle. This determines which mechanics apply and how to interpret events when resolved.
Task
A Task describes what action a character attempts in order to accomplish their Intent. Tasks must be, finite, quantifiable, and performed by the character; e.g. attacking someone with a sword, forcing a door open, or debating in a court of law. 
Test
As described previously, Tests evaluate whether or not a character succeeds at their Task. If a character fails a Test, results can be contested by escalating the level of Conflict. Rolls made against the Test must be based upon a Root Dice value, but other sources of success impact the final quantity of successes.
Resolution
All rolls made against the Test resolve to either a Success, Failure, or Null result. A Null result does not fulfill the Intent of any parties involved in the Test. A Success implies the victor’s narrative Intent takes primary significance in the combination of all involved parties’ Intents, Tasks, and Tests to determine the final narrative Resolution.
Character Creation
Concept
In Ataraxia, dynamic and deep gameplay emerges from the maturation of characters during their adventures. Character concepts start small and vague, and grow complex and defined across time.
Lifepaths
A lifepath constitutes an epoch in a character’s life, usually occurring over several years, that endows the character with skills, traits, connections, resources, and a unique history. Players begin creating their characters by selecting the lifepaths leading up to the point at which gameplay starts.
Stats
Stats constitute a character’s core physical and mental ability across six categories. They build the Attribute health pools and can be Tested in the Action Cycle in situations where no skill is applicable.
To determine a character’s Stats, players first roll 6d6. Then, players assign each of the rolled values to a Stat.   Alternatively, players can opt for a “point-buy” system, in which they select a value between one and six for each of their characters’ Stats out of a total of 20 points. Stats advance using Root Dice advancement rules.
Will 
Will represents a character’s mental tenacity, empathy, focus, and social intelligence. It serves as both a mental and a social stat, and is used in Tests involving character, determination, charm, etc.
Intellect
Intellect represents a character’s ability to process new information, retain knowledge, and assess complex novel situations. It is used in Tests involving memory, calculation, insight, pattern recognition, etc.
Strength
Strength represents a character’s physical power and capability to exert force in the world. It is used in Tests involving weight lifting, contests of strength, forcing past obstacles, etc.
Fortitude
Fortitude represents a character’s physical mettle, durability, and the ability to withstand trauma or wounds. Fortitude is used in Tests involving resisting poison or pain, surviving the elements, etc.
Agility 
Agility represents a character’s physical coordination, as well as their ability to deftly alter momentum. Agility is used in Tests involving reflex, balance, etc.
Endurance
Endurance represents how fast a character moves and how long they can sustain that movement. Endurance is used in Tests involving chases, races, prolonged effort, etc.
Attributes
Attributes constitute the three health pools challenged during the gameplay, and are calculated from a character’s Stat values. Failing a Test damages one of a character’s Attributes; resting recovers the damage a character takes to their Attributes. Characters acquire a semi-permanent Trait if an Attribute is reduced to zero.
Morale
Morale measures a character’s mental state. Stressful situations can impact a character’s psyche, which manifests as damage to their Morale. These situations range from loss of a spirited debate to witnessing the true form of an eldritch abomination from beyond the veil. 
Vitality
Vitality measures a character’s ability to overcome pain and maintain physical health while wounded. Physical injury damages a character’s Vitality. An arrow to the knee, falling from a ledge, and dragon fire would all damage a character’s Vitality.
Stamina
Stamina measures a character’s ability to carry on when weary, react quickly to danger, and outrun threats. Actions that result in exhaustion or fatigue damage a character’s Stamina, such as running a marathon, swimming in turbulent water, and being exposed to the elements.
 
Skills
In Ataraxia a skill is a specialized field of knowledge, experience, or technique known by the character. A skill allows a character to pursue their Beliefs in the world through Tests that involve expertise or knowledge beyond raw natural ability. Examples of skills include Animal Husbandry, Mending, Sorcery, Sword, and Ugly Truth.
Lifepath Skills
Each lifepath is associated with a list of skills which represent what the character has learned during their time in that path. The initial rank of skills gained through the lifepath system is determined by totaling the number of times a skill is acquired across all of a character’s lifepaths and converting that total to the root dice rank for the corresponding skill. For example, a character that had three lifepaths with the ‘Sword’ skill would start the game with that skill at root die rank three.
Learning New Skills
New skills can be learned at any point during play. These skills start at an effective rank 0 with one free bonus die for tests, and must advance to rank 1 before they are considered Root Skills.
Skill Progression
Skills advance using Die Progression rules. If a skill roll receives additional die from Call-On Skills, advancement is still possible, however each new dice also must roll successfully for the skill to advance. Help dice do not count towards or against advancement.
Magic Skills
Magical skills and skills using a magical item function with exploding dice using the Bonus Dice rules. 
Wises
Wises are the experiences gained through a character’s lifepaths that can be called upon to provide more information about the game World, either through the DM or by player invention; e.g. Sailor-Wise, Knight-Wise. Skill Wises can only be used as a Root Die in Variable Tests.
Call-On Skills & Help
Players can add dice to their Test Roll by calling on other related Root Dice or receiving Help from an ally with a related Root Dice. Each Call-On or Help source adds one additional dice to the Test roll without limit, so long that each addition must be explained and justified in its application. 
Personality
While the Action cycle is the primary means of interacting with the world, the motivation underlying characters’ actions play a large part in who they are and the actions they will take.
Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, and Connections represent the personal aspect of the characters, and also allow an opportunity for the player to incorporate these aspects into gameplay Actions. As the characters develop their personality can change through facing victories and defeats. 
Beliefs 
Beliefs are the core principles and ideas that motivate both the player and the character. A major crux of gameplay drama is how these stated beliefs come into conflict with other Beliefs and The World. They function as a method for players to specify aspects of the game that interest them, and for the DM to engage and challenge those interests.
In order for beliefs to be effectively challenged they must first be well articulated and communicated. The framework for several Beliefs are detailed below:
•	A Belief about the current action or task ahead.
•	A goal-oriented Belief about helping, hindering, or learning about a character in the world.
•	A non-goal-oriented ethical statement. 
Instincts 
Instincts are priorities and reactions for the character. They are based on the character’s experiences and have a tangible function. An Instinct is essentially a logical “if/then” or “always/never” statement for the character’s behavior. The player is allowed to determine these Instincts for their character when not in the specified trigger condition. Thus the players have a hedge against future circumstances that fall within the specified criteria, e.g. “If surprised, then I draw my sword.”
Traits 
Traits are quirks and odd abilities that the character acquires through the course of their life. A player starts by selecting traits during character creation, but they can also be acquired through gameplay. Whenever a character drops to zero in an Attribute or rolls a total failure in a Magic check they acquire a Trait related to the circumstances surrounding their defeat. These are not inherently positive or negative, but serve to make the character more complex and interesting. Traits can also be gained or removed as a result of narrative gameplay Actions and DM or group consensus.
Connections
Connections are an abstraction of the relationships that the players bring with them from their lifepaths and those that are developed during the course of play. The application of relationship Connections is fairly broad and can range from asking a favor from a friend, seeking temporary lodging in a settlement, or calling in a favor from a government official. Connections are considered Root Dice, advance using Dice Progression rules, and are subject to the same restrictions as Wises.
Inspiration
Gameplay that aligns or directly challenges a Player Character’s Beliefs, Instincts, Traits, or Connections can be rewarded with an Inspiration Die. Inspiration can be awarded at any time by either the DM or through nomination by a player with the consensus of all players. These dice can be used on any rolls and function using Bonus Dice rules.
Gear, Equipment & Property
Gear and equipment are another critical aspect of a character’s personality and capabilities. Items that are used in the course of a Test grant a point of Advantage. There are a number of points to consider when using Items; the application of each item must be justified for the intended Task, items often cost precious coins that could be spent recovering in the safety of a town, characters have limited inventory space and must determine what items are the most valuable to carry, and Items have a chance of becoming damaged through use.
Conflict
The conflict system is designed to seamlessly be integrated in the core Action cycle without any boundary between what would traditionally be considered ‘role play’ and ‘combat’ sections of gameplay. The intent is to shift the focus from tactical positioning to balancing risk and reward.
General Rules
When there is a discrete target in a Test, rolls below the target result in damage to the appropriate attribute equal to the difference between the roll and the target. Generally, social conflict damages Morale, physical conflict damages Vitality, and environmental conflict damages Stamina. These distributions can change in light of context or in the Duel level of conflict where each can be targeted individually
Damage accrues after each test cycle. For example, if a series of cascading rolls are taken the difference in values is subtracted from the loser for each opposed roll cycle.
Escalation Methodology
All tests are built on the foundations of the previous test, and a test can be escalated to a higher level at any point by any party involved in the test. In practice this is analogous to doubling down and increasing the stakes at play in the test. Each new level test comes with a chance to reverse the players fate, but also a risk of further damage. Conflicts cannot be de-escalated down the chain and can only stop when a resolution has been achieved by one party either yielding or reducing an attribute to zero.
Group Conflict
All conflict is fundamentally between a single primary character and an opposing force. In situations where multiple characters are involved other players can contribute Help to the primary player to bind their fate together. Players who have elected to bind their fate together share both victories and defeats. In the event of a failed Test, damage dealt is totaled and distributed internally to the characters involved up to the quantity of help they provided. The character acting in the primary role will change dynamically as the narrative demands; however, it can also be determined following turn order or initiative rules. 
Free Test
No roll is required for Free Tests. These are actions like picking up a light object or walking across the room.
Variable Test
Variable Tests are open-ended skill tests that pose no direct consequence to the PC for low rolls. These are typically uncontested actions that are only defined by the success of one party such as asking a stranger for help, jumping on flat ground, or fishing.
Static Test
Static Tests are made against a discrete value and constitute a risk to the PC following general damage rules. These are actions such as bribing a guard, leaping over a crevice, or fording a river. The player must meet or exceed the stated target value to succeed at the test. 
Opposed Test
Opposed Tests are made when the opponent is an intelligent agent using their own Root Dice. Both parties roll and compare successes. These are actions such as a short argument, arm wrestling match, or foot race. If the rolls result in a tie there is either a null outcome where neither stated Intents are fulfilled, or one party elects to escalate the conflict. 
Cascading Test
Cascading Tests are an escalation of Opposed Tests. In the event the loser of an Opposed Test contests the result they may choose a previously unused skill and repeat the process. The victor of the previous Opposed Test can either keep their previous result or reroll using the same Root Die. Examples of this are a spirited debate, a street fight, or a cross-country hunt.
Advanced Tests
This section offers more options for the player to alter their numbers in risk/reward gambles. These can be used in any combination and at any test level
Attack
An Attack is an action to oppose an adversary by force. Through risk and self-sacrifice players can burn Attribute points to add successes to a Test roll before the result are known. Examples include dropping your guard and lunging with a sword, pushing oneself beyond limits in a race, or accepting a contested point in an argument in order to gain a stronger position. 
Defend
Defense is an effort to drive danger or attack away, to maintain support in the face of argument or criticism, or to prove a point valid. Players can withhold ‘damage’ from their current Test after the it has been resolved as a point of Advantage to their next roll. Examples include parrying a blow, taking a moment to catch your breath, or holding to a strong point in an argument.
Maneuver
Maneuvers are an alteration position or evasion in the value of play, be it in range or relation. Players can gamble by sacrificing root dice during a Test before the result are known, which then grant a point of Advantage to their next roll. Example include a feign in a duel, taking a shortcut in a race, or changing the frame of a debate.
Defeat
Attribute Depletion
In the event that a character drops to zero in an Attribute during an Action cycle, they lose the ability to participate in opposed Tests until the Attribute has been restored. When an Attribute recovers above zero the character gains a Trait corresponding to the nature of the Defeat. These are typically DM determined, but can be proposed by the players as well.
Death
Players must be willing for their character to die and consult with the DM when they believe that an event should result in the death their character.
Rests
Rests offer characters an opportunity to replenish lost Attribute pools. If the conditions required to heal are met, the rate of recovery is determined by rolling the remaining dice for an Attribute and adding successes back to the pool up to the maximum value. In the event that an Attribute has been reduced to zero during the course of play, the character is granted a free recovery dice provided the rest requirements have been met.
Requirements
Characters must have food, water, and shelter for in order to rest and recover. If these are unable to be acquired the character does not gain any benefits from resting and suffers negative effects. Characters may rest multiple rest cycles (days, months, years) if the conditions to do so are met. This can either be done in the wilderness or in the safety of a town depending on the capability and resources of the characters involved.
Recovery
Morale is decreased by stress, and restored with rest. Characters require shelter & sleep to enable recovery. A day without sleep decreases Morale by one point.
Vitality is decreased by injury, and restored with food. Characters require one ration of food to enable recovery. A day without food decreases vitality by one point.
Stamina is decreased by fatigue, and restored with water. Characters require one ration of water to enable recovery. A day without water decreases Stamina by one point.
Substances
Various substances can be imbibed to aid with Attribute recovery while resting. Active substances immediately grant a temporary point to the appropriate Attribute pool, and the effects last until the next rest cycle. Passive substances grant Advantage on recovery checks for the corresponding Attribute. Multiple doses do not stack within any given rest cycle.
Light
Light is a resource that extends to a certain number of characters per source and is expended over time. A source of light improves visibility by one rank. Candles provide dim light for one character and cannot be moved, torches provide dim light for two characters, and lanterns provide dim light for a whole group. Magic is unique in that it is dynamic, and cannot be put out by natural means.
Bright Light 
Bright Light is considered anything ranging from daylight to a well-lit tavern. Characters rolls are unaffected when in the presence of Bright Light
Dim Light 
Characters not completely covered by light or darkness are considered to be in dim light. PC’s rolls are made at Disadvantage when in Dim Light
Darkness 
In total darkness like what is found in deep caves and moonless nights, characters cannot attempt any Test that depends on sight. Of the remaining available tests, in addition to penalties from dim light, characters gain a point of Vulnerability to all attributes.
 
Lifepaths
A character is built step-by-step, from birth through the tumult of life, up to the day their new calling – The Adventure – enters their life.  A lifepath constitutes an epoch in a character’s life, usually occurring over several years, that endows the character with skills, traits, connections, resources, and a unique history. Players begin creating their characters by selecting the lifepaths leading up to the point at which gameplay starts.
Please refer to Burning Wheel for a full lifepath list. (http://charred-black.herokuapp.com/#/)
Born Setting
Character begins their journey by being born into a particular setting which constitutes the first Lifepath taken during character creation. This represents not only the character’s actual birth, but the social and economic setting where they spent their childhood.
Navigation
Once a Born Setting has been selected character’s follow one of the Leads available to determine the path they take in the world. Players may select from the current and previous lifepath Leads for their next lifepath. 
Players may always select one of the Leads from the lifepath they were born into as well as the leads from the Born Outlaw lifepath.
Elements
Each lifepath grows the character experiencing it, and grants them Time, Traits, Resources, Stat points, Skills, Skill Points, and Settings or links into new lifepaths. As players grow their character across multiple lifepaths each element is added to a total which is used during the start of play.
Time
The time column indicates how long in years a particular lifepath takes to complete. After all lifepaths have been chosen, years are totaled to determine the age of the character.
Resources (gp)
Players use resources in the form of gold pieces (gp) acquired and saved through the course of their lifepath. These can be used to purchase material possessions, land, and property. 
Skills
Each lifepath presents a set of skills that are learned during the duration of that lifepath. Each duplicate skill acquired adds an additional rank to the particular skill.
Leads*
Where life leads is strange and unpredictable. Often a character cannot decide the path ahead of them and must follow life’s leads. In character creation a lead is a possibility or opportunity to change. 
 
Gear & Equipment
Items
Items impart Advantage when used as part of a skill roll. Like the Call-On feature, the applicability of the item used must be justified. Multiple items can be used on a single Test if the use each can be reasoned.
Inventory
Some items are consumable and light enough that multiples can fit into a single inventory slot. These are indicated by a (x) marker where x is the number of uses in a stack. Conversely, some heavy items occupy more than one inventory slot and are indicated as such with a [x] marker with x corresponding to the number of slots taken up. For rough approximations an inventory slot can take up to around 3 lbs. of weight.
Total inventory slots are determined by the sum of Morale, Vitality, and Stamina. Characters carrying more items than their total inventory slots allow accrue a point of Stamina Vulnerability for every item inventory slot over their limit.
Coins
Copper coins are used as the base currency, and higher value coins can be used when appropriate. Silver coins are worth 20 copper coins and gold coins are worth 1000 copper coins. Coins also occupy inventory slots in stacks of (50) coins. For rough approximations a copper coin has around the purchasing power of a U.S. dollar.
Degradation
If during the course of a Test the player rolls a total failure while using an item, the item breaks and must be repaired before it can be used again. Not all items will be able to be repaired, but generally the cost to repair an item is half of its market value.
Magic Items
Magic items are rare pieces of Gear & Equipment that have been imbued with arcane energy to produce both strange and powerful properties. Such items grant Exploding Dice in any Test they are used in, cannot be Degraded, and often grant special abilities related to the spell used to create them.
Tools & Gear
These are devices or implements that can be used to carry out a particular function. In practice they include crafting tools, adventuring gear, and household items.
Light
Light is a resource that extends to a certain number of characters per source and is expended over time. A source of light improves visibility by one rank.
Clothing
Clothing serves to protect a character from the elements as well as to indicate the social status of the wearer.
Lodging
Locations in towns and cities offer the chance for characters to recover from their stress, injuries, and exhaustion in a safe location at the cost of coin rather than skill and risk. 
Food & Drink
Whether just purchasing enough to subsist while in town or stocking up for an arduous journey, food and drink are essential for recovery and survival.
Substances
Various substances can be imbibed to aid with recovery in either Morale, Vitality, or Stamina. Multiple doses do not stack within any given rest cycle.
Luxury Items
Some items, either by the nature of their rarity or difficulty in producing, are considered Luxury Items and can only be found in areas of wealth and culture.
Armor
Armor functions to reduce or mitigate incoming damage to an Attribute through Damage Reduction. This extra protection often comes at the cost of extra weight. 
Weapons
A weapon is a type of tool used with the purpose to injure, defeat, or destroy an opponent. Like all items, weapons may be used in a Test to grant a point of advantage provided their use can be justified. Each weapon has an effective range that corresponds to the Martial Combat rule system and an Armor Penetration (AP) value. 
AP damage values are only applied to counter Vitality Resistance in   a Test roll; e.g. a Test made using a crossbow with a roll of 4 against an armored opponent with a roll of 3 and Vitality Resistance roll of 1 would do 1 damage.
Property & Services
For costs exceeding a character’s current finances, consider taking out a loan with a nearby Noble or Merchant.
Livestock
Livestock are domesticated animals used to produce labor and commodities. Some animals are able to act as beasts of burden by carrying characters and items
Hirelings
The world is full of people looking to market their trade in exchange for some coin. As characters grow in wealth Hirelings can be contracted to aid them in their efforts.
Transport
Barriers of land and sea can be overcome by paying for passage across established routes. These are for one way trips and transportation of goods.
Ships
A sailing ship is a sea-going vessel that uses sails mounted on masts to harness the power of wind and propel the vessel to new lands and opportunity.
Property
Property constitutes the land plus anything growing on it, attached to it or erected on it, including man-made objects, such as buildings, structures, roads, sewers, and fences.

Extra Stuff Intro*
Magic refers to the system of arcane words which are combined into phrases and spoken aloud to alter the natural world. These words are divided into categories of Change, Substance, Quantity, Location, and Duration. The schools of change are associated with particular magical skills that are used as the Root Die for particular words.
Technique*
Once a player has established a magic spell that they are familiar with and a consensus of its effects has been established, the caster can begin the process of instantiating the spell in a physical Spell Focus.

Martial Combat
Magic refers to the system of arcane words which are combined into phrases and spoken aloud to alter the natural world. These words are divided into categories of Change, Substance, Quantity, Location, and Duration. The schools of change are associated with particular magical skills that are used as the Root Die for particular words.
Spells are built by constructing a phrase using one word from each category and summing the cost of each word to determine the total check to cast the stated spell successfully. The combination of words allows for a substantial number of unique possibilities, with greater control and impact coming at a higher threshold cost to cast. All normal rules for skills apply to magic skills.

Warping
A constant danger faced when casting spells is the risk of Warping. Whenever a caster rolls a total failure on a spell Test the caster loses control of the spell and suffers permanent changes as a result. The spell produces different effects than specified in the Intent section of the Action Cycle, and the caster suffers a permanent Trait associated with the spell.
Learning Spells
The words a caster is able to know is determined by summing 	the rank of all magical skills and spending this value on words based on their associated casting cost. For example; a character with a Sorcery skill of 3 and a Summoning skill of 5 would have a total of 8 points to spend on known words. 
Spell focuses*
Once a player has established a magic spell that they are familiar with and a consensus of its effects has been established, the caster can begin the process of instantiating the spell in a physical Spell Focus. Focuses can take the form of a spell tome, rosary beads, or other object that aids in the mnemonic recall of the spell and its associated intent. Once a focus has been created, and is in the character’s inventory, the caster will gain Advantage on rolls to cast that spell, thus negating the risk of Warping. Focuses take up one inventory slot. 
 
Divine*
Magic, though a very powerful force, is not omnipotent. There are certain laws it must conform to and certain limits that it can never exceed. The limits to Hermetic magic are described below. Most Hermetic theorists believe that there are only two fundamental limits, the Limit of the Divine and that the other limits are derived from one or other of these. 
Hermetic Order*
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
Limitations
The Limit of the Divine
Hermetic magic cannot affect the Divine. Any magic attempting to do so simply fails. The agents of the Divine, such as saints and angels, are protected from magic to some extent, but are not normally completely immune. As a general rule, any being with a will separate from God’s can be affected by magic, at least in principle. Only direct action by God is completely immune.
The Limit of Essential Nature
Any magic which violates a thing’s essential nature must be maintained, and when power is no longer supplied the thing returns to its natural state. Thus, Mutatio magic must always be maintained, while the effects of Augere or Diminutio magic persist after the spell expires. A thing’s essential nature cannot itself be changed. While Hermetic magic can completely change the way a thing appears, it cannot affect what that thing is. A thing’s essential nature varies depending on what it is. While these limits are recognized in the academy, they are often tested by initiates and ambition members of their orders.
The Limit of Arcane Connections
Hermetic magic cannot affect an unsensed target without an Arcane Connection. For example: Diminutio Animo magic cannot affect those people until the magus is aware of them.
The Limit of Creation
Hermetic magic is incapable of creating anything permanently without raw arcane energy. This limit affects all uses of Genus magic. However, as Genus magic does not violate the essential nature of its target, Genus magic that does use raw arcane energy does not need to be maintained. Theorists are divided on whether this derives from the Limit of the Divine or the Limit of Essential Nature. 
 
The Limit of the Celestial Sphere
Hermetic magic cannot affect the celestial sphere, nor anything above it. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of the Divine. The lunar sphere is the innermost of the celestial spheres, which carry the stars and planets ontheir revolutions around the earth, and so this limit rarely bothers magi directly.
The Limit of the Soul
Hermetic magic cannot create an immortal soul, and so may not create true human life nor restore the dead to life. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of the Divine, although a significant number think that Hermetic magic’s inability to raise the dead reflects nothing more than a flaw in the theory. Animals have no immortal souls, and so may be created. Magical creatures and faeries are generally believed not to have immortal souls, and there are spells that appear to create them, but some magi believe that such spells really summon existing beings. Angels and demons are nothing but immortal souls.
The Limit of Warping
Prolonged exposure to active magic or high auras usually causes changes, generally referred to as warping. Hermetic magic is completely unable to affect these changes once they have happened. Most magi would like to believe that this derives from the Limit of the Divine, as that would make magic a manifestation of Divine power.
The Limit of Energy
Hermetic magic cannot restore one’s Attributes; i.e. Morale, Vitality, or Stamina. Most magi think that this is a flaw in Hermetic theory, although some believe it is related to the limits of the soul.
The Limit of Time
Hermetic magic is incapable of altering the passage of time. It cannot affect anything in the past, and can only affect the future by making changes in the present. This limit also means that Hermetic magic cannot scry on the past or future. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of the Divine.

The World 
The map is not the territory. What arises from this method is a word seen through a narrative lens independent of exact distances or even time. At a minimum journeying through a terrain card takes a full day, however much greater lengths of time can pass as complications arise and the players dig into the emergent story. It is recommended to allow time to flow naturally. Don’t force things. Let encounters arise naturally and follow the flow. Don’t skip ahead into combat without the escalation. It will feel flat and without context.
Time
Distance is measured in time and time is measured in moments. There is no exact science to determining passage of time in the game except for the punctuation of the daily cycle. If longer cycles are required use the 28 day lunar cycle and 365 day solar cycle. Be lose with the length of time moment to moment, but strict with the tracking of days.
Travel
Problems: journeying across contesting kingdoms are very jealous of trade with neighbors. Often imposing steep tolls on guarded passes or along river ports, sometimes forcing sale at the location or high taxes.
Exploration
How do the cards interface with skills, exploration scouting?
Arcana
Each of the minor arcana cards serve as a set piece for action and drama. The stage is set by the terrain and weather, and the theme and conflict are determined by the card suit and meaning. All that is left to generate the drama is for the PC’s to act according to their character.
